Project template for AppEngine

Offers quick and easy setup of all of the following:
- buildout
- AppEngine SDK
- flask framework
- unit tests


Unlike most alternatives, this boilerplate relies heavily on buildout. Source code of the dependencies is never stored inside your project.
This template contains everything necessary for a basic website or a webapp, yet tries to remain as small and flexible as possible.


Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

# git clone https://github.com/paulftw/appengine-flask-template.git mycoolwebsite


2. Virtualenv is not required but highly recommended, because it's awesome. I'm using virtualenvwrapper, so:

# mkvirtualenv mycoolwebsite
# workon mycoolwebsite


3. Fetch buildout and install all dependencies:

# python bootstrap.py -v 1.7.0
# bin/buildout


4. Start a dev server

# bin/dev_appserver app
and open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser


5. ???


6. Profit!
